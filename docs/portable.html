    This variant works on any operating system, so long as <a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a> is installed. To run
    it, extract the package contents and double-click on <code>Server.jar</code>. If any firewall notices appear, click
    <code>Allow</code>.

    If the mouse cursor disappears while using this version on Ubuntu, consider switching to the installer. It contains
    a script that fixes the problem during installation. Alternatively, you can fix it yourself using the method
    described in <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}/12">this thread</a>.
